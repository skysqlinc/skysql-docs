# SkySQL MCP Server

The **SkySQL Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** offers a powerful interface for managing your SkySQL database instances and interacting with **SkyAI Agents**. It bridges the gap between your databases and AI-powered development tools.

## What is SkySQL MCP Server?

The SkySQL MCP Server acts as an intermediary, allowing AI applications like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and Visual Studio Code Copilot to securely and efficiently interact with your SkySQL databases. It exposes your data in a structured way that AI tools can query, transforming complex database interactions into intuitive, real-time conversations.
