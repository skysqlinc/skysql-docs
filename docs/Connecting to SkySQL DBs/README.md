# Connecting to Sky DBs

This page describes how to connect to a SkySQL database using a MariaDB-compatible client.

### **Important - Whitelist your IP address first**

!!! Note
    ðŸ’¡ **Access to all services are protected by a firewall, by default. You need to IP whitelist your clientâ€™s (your desktop, laptop or server) IP. Just select â€˜Manage â€”> Security Accessâ€™ and then click â€˜Add my current IPâ€™ to add the IP of your current workstation (laptop, desktop).**

!!! Note
    ðŸ’¡ **If you are not sure or unable to obtain the IP address, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 to effectively disable the firewall. Goes without saying â€” donâ€™t do this for your production DBs.**


For more details go to theÂ [Firewall](<../Security/Configuring Firewall.md>)Â settings page. 



## Connecting using the MariaDB Client CLI

Once your DB service is launched, click on the â€˜Connectâ€™ option for your service on the dashboard. This pops up all the required attributes to connect from any SQL client. 

Connection parameters include:

- Default username
- Default password
- Hostname (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
- TCP port (3306 or 3307)
- ssl-verify-server-cert (if SSL is ON)

!!! Note
    ðŸ’¡ Unlike previous SkySQL versions, the current version no longer requires clients to supply the Server SSL Certificate for SSL connections. Customers who migrated from MariaDB corporation to SkySQL Inc can continue to use provided certificates (when using the previous SkySQL method for connecting). But, we strongly recommend moving to the connection properties as shown in the Connect window for your service.

!!! Note
    ðŸ’¡ **There is a default config change in the 11.4.2 MariaDB client that requires SSL. This needs to be disabled by setting ```--ssl-verify-server-cert=0```.**

### Install and Connect using the MariaDB client

After [installing the MariaDB client](./Connect%20using%20MariaDB%20CLI.md) according to your operating system, simply copy/paste the MariaDB CLI command as displayed in the Connect window. 

## Connecting from your Application

Applications can connect to SkySQL using any of the below MariaDB supported connectors. There are several other connectors from the community too. 

- [C](Connect%20from%20â€˜Câ€™%20App.md)
- [C++](Connect%20from%20â€˜C++â€™%20App.md)
- [Java](Connect%20from%20Java%20App.md)
- [Java R2DBC](Connect%20using%20Connector%20R2DBC.md)
- [Node.js (JavaScript)](Connect%20from%20Node%20js%20App.md)
- [ODBC API](Connect%20using%20ODBC.md)
- [Python](Connect%20from%20Python%20App.md)
- [MongoDB Client](Connect%20from%20MongoDB%20clients.md)


!!! Note
    ðŸ’¡ For <Mariadb> Server With Replica(s), you can also use any MongoDB client and use theÂ [NoSQL Interface](Connect%20from%20MongoDB%20clients.md)


## Connecting from SQL tools

Clients listed here have been tested to properly connect with SkySQL and execute queries.

Most of the SQL clients and editors natively support MariaDB. Most often you can also just select 'MySQL' and connect to your SkySQL DB service. 

- [Connecting using Java clients like Squirrel SQL](https://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.io/)  
    - All you need to do is to make sure the "useSsl" property is set to 'true' if SSL is ON. 
- MariaDB CLI
- [Sequel Ace](https://sequel-ace.com/) - Connect to MariaDB from MacOS
    - In the connection window, you should select 'Require SSL' if your SkySQL database has SSL turned ON (the default). 

### Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

The following GUI clients have been tested to properly connect with SkySQL and execute queries. Most SQL clients and editors natively support MariaDB. You can often select 'MySQL' as the connection type to connect to your SkySQL DB service.

- [Connect using DBeaver](Connect%20using%20DBeaver.md) SkyDBA Recommended
- [Connect using DBGate](Connect%20using%20DBGate.md)
- [Connect using HeidiSQL](Connect%20using%20HeidiSQL.md)
- [Connect using TablePlus](Connect%20using%20TablePlus.md)
