The easiest way to get started with the API is to use [this swagger Docs](https://apidocs.skysql.com). Just [generate your API key](<../Security/Managing API keys.md>) , Click `Authorize` and enter `<yourAPI Key>` and try out any of the APIs.

You can use the REST API to Provision, get pricing and billing information, fetch/change service or MariaDB configuration, Manage users and their roles, schedule backups or restores, scale, stop and Delete services. 

Please refer to the [API docs](https://apidocs.skysql.com) for examples and a complete list of all the APIs.
