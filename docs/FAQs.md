# FAQs

## About

### **What is the history of SkySQL?**

SkySQL is a database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that was originally developed and managed by MariaDB Corporation. The cloud division (SkySQL) was later spun out of MariaDB into a independent company -  [SkySQL Inc](https://skysql.com).  The team that developed SkySQL transitioned over to the new company.

### **How do I sign up for SkySQL?**

1. Go to [https://app.skysql.com](https://app.skysql.com/)
2. Log in or register using social login or email.
3. Once registered, you can get started right away by [launching a service](../Quickstart), [connecting](<../Connecting to Sky DBs>), and [loading data](<../Data loading, Migration>).

### **Why would I choose a DBaaS over an on-premises deployment?**

Our platform and experts handle the infrastructure needs, allowing you to focus on your core business.

When you choose SkySQL, a full-featured DBaaS, you forego the capital expenditure of buying hardware, the delay of waiting for new systems to ship every time you need to scale-up or scale-out, and the overhead and opportunity-cost of tuning, monitoring, and upgrading your database. SkySQL also handles routine tasks such as nightly backups and infrastructure maintenance.

And if you need ultimate control, and have the necessary skills and resources to hand-pick instances and tune configurations, we offer SkySQL [Power Tier](<../Billing and Power Tier>) to deliver all of the on-premises benefits without the capex (capital expense) and operational overhead.

### **How long do deployments on SkySQL take?**

In Foundation Tier smaller databases launch in 2-4 mins. Power Tier deployments with isolated, dedicated Kubernetes environments can take up to 25 minutes. Subsequent database deployments will use the same Kubernetes environment and usually launch in 2-4 minutes.

The real time benefits come every day after, when you're operating at scale. A failed database node can recover in a matter of seconds using Kubernetes self-healing, or instantly failover to alternate replicated server. Instead of an eight-hour bare metal rebuild as you might see on-premises or on other cloud platforms.

### **What version of MariaDB does SkySQL support?**

SkySQL provides services backed by:

- MariaDB Community Server 11.4
- MariaDB Community Server 10.11
- MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6
- MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.5
- MariaDB MaxScale

### **Are other databases supported?**

No, SkySQL is dedicated to being the top choice for MariaDB. Our goal is to provide the best price-performance of any DBaaS, offer significant productivity improvements through automation, and serve as the most comprehensive end-to-end platform for all your database needs.

We offer “fractional DBAs” - expert-maintained multi-cloud databases. We're glad to help with your move to SkySQL, whether you're [migrating](<../Data loading, Migration>) from another database platform or looking to [lift-and-shift](<../Data loading, Migration>) a MariaDB implementation to SkySQL.

### **What hardware does SkySQL run on?**

SkySQL is multi-cloud and as a full-featured DBaaS we handle all of the hardware and infrastructure needs.

Services are currently available with a range of [instance sizes](<../Reference Guide/Instance Size Choices>) running on the following cloud service providers:

- Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Current month's estimated charges can be viewed on the SkySQL portal dashboard. Detailed information is also available under ‘Billing’ where you can see the breakdown for all your current charges - you can see resource usage by Service Name (your individual DB clusters) or by resource type. Variable charges such as object storage and network egress are updated the day prior to the last day of the month and are available in the invoice. You can also use the [SkySQL REST API](https://apidocs.skysql.com/) to fetch usage and billing data.

### **How can I see detailed billing reports?**

Cryptography libraries are included in our standard release process, and vulnerability scanning is conducted for each release.

## **Data Deletion**

### **Can I delete my running or stopped SkySQL service?**

Yes. The decision to delete your running service rests with you and your business. Please consider production impacts before deleting a service. SkySQL permits the on-demand deletion of running and stopped services.

### **Can I delete my pending SkySQL service?**

No. The launch process must complete before deletion is permitted.

### **How long do you keep my data when I delete a service?**

All data residing on a service's storage is deleted at time of service deletion. Backups for deleted services are purged after 7 days.

### **Can I get my data back if I delete a service by accident?**

Maybe. If you contact us before the system completes data deletion, yes, we can recover. Backups for deleted services are purged after 7 days.

### **Is it possible for SkySQL to retain my data when I delete a service?**

No. You should download your data so you have a local copy before you delete the service.

### **Will my data be retained if a hard drive gets swapped-out?**

No. SkySQL is hosted on public cloud provider systems.
