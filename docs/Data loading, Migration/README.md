### Option 2: Custom Migration

For most small, mid-size and large migrations SkySQL Managed Migration is the quickest and safest option. However, for large migrations or migrations with specific requirements, you and your team may require more flexibility and control over the migration process. In these cases, you and your team can design a custom migration plan considering the options suggested below.
