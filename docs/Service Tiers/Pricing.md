# Pricing

SkySQL pricing information is shown at time of service launch.

Pricing shown within the SkySQL interface is an estimate of the cost of using SkySQL services based on your specified usage parameters. Pricing information is shown at time of service launch and subsequently as estimated charges.

The cost shown is not a quote and does not guarantee the cost for your actual use of SkySQL services.

## Estimated Pricing

The cost estimate may vary from your actual costs for several reasons, including:

- **Actual usage**: Your actual cost will be based on your actual use of the services, not the estimate.

- **Region**: The prices for SkySQL services may vary between regions. Using a different region than the one selected may affect the results.

- **Price changes**: On-demand pricing for most services may change over time. If you buy services on-demand, your bill may be less or more than estimated based on the current on-demand rates.

- **Taxes**: The estimate does not include any taxes that may be applied to your purchase of the services.

- **Time frame assumptions**: On-demand monthly pricing assumes that your instance or node runs for a 730 hour month. The estimate does not account for leap years, which add one additional day (24 hours).

- **Promotional credits and discounts**: The estimate does not account for promotional credits or other discounts.

- **Monthly billing period**: MariaDB bills on a monthly basis. If your utilization starts mid-month, you will only see a portion of an actual month's full costs on your invoice.

- **Rounding**: Estimated fees include mathematical rounding of pricing data.

- **Scale fabric**: Scale fabric costs represent the additional network, host, and backup infrastructure needed to support multi-node topologies.

- **Previous services**: The estimate is only for the service being launched and does not account for other current or previous charges to the SkySQL account.

- **Cross-Region Replicas**: The estimate does not include cross-region replicas.

- **Currency**: Estimates are provided in either US dollars or Euros depending on your account address country. Your actual cost will be based on US dollar pricing with a conversion to Euros depending on your account address country.
