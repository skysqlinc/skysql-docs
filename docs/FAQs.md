## Overview

### What is SkySQL?
SkySQL is a modern database as a service (DBaaS) solution for production MySQL and MariaDB workloads. It simplifies database management with automated configuration, autonomous scaling, global replication, enterprise-grade security, real-time observability, automated backups and more. SkySQL delivers ultimate flexibility, reliability, performance and effortless management for your databases allowing you to focus on your application features. SkySQL provides both provisioned servers and serverless deployment options to handle a variety of use cases from mission-critical, always-on production to experimental, spiky workloads.

### What is the history of SkySQL?
SkySQL is a database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that was originally developed and managed by MariaDB Corporation. The cloud division (SkySQL) was later spun out of MariaDB into a independent company -  [SkySQL Inc](https://skysql.com).  The team that developed SkySQL transitioned over to the new company.

### Where is SkySQL available? What instance and storage options are available?
SkySQL is available across 40+ global regions on Amazon AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Database services on SkySQL support a range of [instance](<../Reference Guide/Instance Size Choices>) sizes. Storage starts at 10GB and can scale up to 9000GB. SkySQL's autonomous scaling takes the guesswork out of provisioning. You can start small and scale automatically as your needs evolve. 

### How do I get started?
You can sign up for a free account at [https://app.skysql.com](https://app.skysql.com/). There is no credit card required to start and you get $100 in free credit. Once registered, you can get started right away by [launching a service](../Quickstart), [connecting](<../Connecting to Sky DBs>), and [loading data](<../Data loading, Migration>).

### How quickly can I launch a new database?
Launching a new database service with SkySQL is quick and easy. Serverless database services start in miliseconds. Provisioned Database services start in 2-4 min. 

### Is SkySQL ready for production use?

Multi-node databases feature a comprehensive [SLA](</Uptime SLA>), High Availability (HA) features, and operations features. [Enterprise support](https://skysql.com/support-policy/) options extend support to 24x7, with the additional option of [SkyDBA](<../FractionalDBA>) for proactive assistance from a team of expert DBAs.

### What is the history of SkySQL?
SkySQL was originally developed and [launched in early 2020](https://mariadb.com/newsroom/press-releases/mariadb-skysql-launches-delivers-next-generation-cloud-database/) by MariaDB Corporation.

## Pricing

### How much does SkySQL cost?
You can get started on SkySQL at no cost for experimenting and early development using the forever-free serverless option. Provisioned database services on SkySQL are billed based on the topology, cloud region, instance and storage sizes. For example, you can run a single 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM instance with 100GB storage on AWS us-east-1 region 24/7 for for little over $100 a month. 

When you [launch a database service](<../Portal features/Launch page>), SkySQL provides a handy estimate of how much your service selections will cost. Multi-node database services incur charge for running our intelligent proxy. Data Transfer charges associated with your service vary based on the usage and are not included in the estimates. We passthrough data transfer charges levied by cloud providers with no additional markup. 

If you stop a service, you will continue to be charged for storage, since your data is not deleted. Instance and egress charges will stop until the instance is started again.

Your database service cost includes Standard support and nightly backups. See the [Pricing](<./Billing and Power Tier/Pricing.md>) page for additional details on pricing.

## Backup, Restore and Deletion

### How do I backup my data on SkySQL?
SkySQL performs full backup of your database services each night. You can also use SkySQL's [Backup Service](<./Backup and Restore/>) to schedule backups and perform restores. The Backup Service supports Snapshot, Full, Incremental and Logical Dump backups. You can perform restore on the same database or another database in the same or different region using the Backup Service.

### Are automated backups sent offsite? Will my data be sent to another country?
No. All data is managed within the same region by default where your database is running for data sovereignty.

### Do backup operations impact application performance?
No. MariaDB Backup (mariabackup) is used for Replicated Transactions and Single Node Transactions service backups. MariaDB Backup breaks up backups into non-blocking stages so writes and schema changes can occur during backups.

### How long are backups retained?
SkySQL's nightly backups as well as self-service backups are retained for 7 days.

### Does SkySQL support Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)?
By default, full and complete backup restoration is available. To enable point-in-time recovery, services must be configured in advance for additional binary log retention. [Point-in-time recovery (PITR)](<../Backup and Restore/Point-in-Time Restore/>) configuration is available to Power Tier customers.

### How long do you keep my data when I delete a service?
All data residing on a service's storage is deleted at time of service deletion. Backups for deleted services are purged after 7 days.

## Security

### Will all my data be encrypted?
Yes. By default, SkySQL encrypts all data-in-transit using standard SSL/TSL. While not recommended, you can disable SSL/TLS connections while launching a database service. SkySQL leverages HashiCorp Vault for certificate and key management. Certificates and keys are not customer-configurable at this time.

All data-at-rest is encrypted using standard cloud encryption options.
- Amazon AWS[Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html).
- Google Cloud [encryption by default](https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-at-rest/default-encryption).
- Microsoft Azure [default encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption).

### Are client certificates supported?
No. SkySQL supports server-side certificates. Database users are authenticated by standard password authentication.
