# FAQs

### **What is the history of SkySQL?**

SkySQL is a database-as-a-service (DBaaS) that was originally developed and managed by MariaDB Corporation. The cloud division (SkySQL) was later spun out of MariaDB into a independent company -  [SkySQL Inc](https://skysql.com).  The team that developed SkySQL transitioned over to the new company.

### **How do I sign up for SkySQL?**

1. Go to [https://app.skysql.com](https://app.skysql.com/)
2. Log in or register using social login or email.
3. Once registered, you can get started right away by [launching a service](../Quickstart%20da3c5848d30348b1815026b2d24219a6), [connecting](../Connecting%20to%20Sky%20DBs%20ae0bd7d47675416e9cd0bf2ba21d066c), and [loading data](../Data%20loading,%20Migration%208d6075f7123a4b59bedfeaad01d8461a).

### **Why would I choose a DBaaS over an on-premises deployment?**

Our platform and experts handle the infrastructure needs, allowing you to focus on your core business.

When you choose SkySQL, a full-featured DBaaS, you forego the capital expenditure of buying hardware, the delay of waiting for new systems to ship every time you need to scale-up or scale-out, and the overhead and opportunity-cost of tuning, monitoring, and upgrading your database. SkySQL also handles routine tasks such as nightly backups and infrastructure maintenance.

And if you need ultimate control, and have the necessary skills and resources to hand-pick instances and tune configurations, we offer SkySQL [Power Tier](../Billing%20and%20Power%20Tier%203168a8895e7342aead007c253d998c8d) to deliver all of the on-premises benefits without the capex (capital expense) and operational overhead.

### **How long do deployments on SkySQL take?**

In Foundation Tier smaller databases launch in 2-4 mins. Power Tier deployments with isolated, dedicated Kubernetes environments can take up to 25 minutes. Subsequent database deployments will use the same Kubernetes environment and usually launch in 2-4 minutes. 

The real time benefits come every day after, when you're operating at scale. A failed database node can recover in a matter of seconds using Kubernetes self-healing, or instantly failover to alternate replicated server. Instead of an eight-hour bare metal rebuild as you might see on-premises or on other cloud platforms.

### **What version of MariaDB does SkySQL support?**

SkySQL provides services backed by:

- MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4
- MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.5
- MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6
- MariaDB MaxScale
- 

### **Are other databases supported?**

No, SkySQL is dedicated to being the top choice for MariaDB. Our goal is to provide the best price-performance of any DBaaS, offer significant productivity improvements through automation, and serve as the most comprehensive end-to-end platform for all your database needs.

We offer “fractional DBAs” - expert-maintained multi-cloud databases. We're glad to help with your move to SkySQL, whether you're [migrating](../Data%20loading,%20Migration%208d6075f7123a4b59bedfeaad01d8461a) from another database platform or looking to [lift-and-shift](../Data%20loading,%20Migration%208d6075f7123a4b59bedfeaad01d8461a) a MariaDB implementation to SkySQL.

### **What hardware does SkySQL run on?**
